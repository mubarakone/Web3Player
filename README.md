### An open-source Web3 enabled video player for you to embed in your website.

## Installation
Download the `web3-player.js` file into your workspace folder.

Open your HTML file and add the Javascript file to your script tags.

`<script src="web3-player.js"></script>`

Then you can embed the video player with these custom elements:

```
<web3-video></web3-video>
```
Once you have the video on your page, be sure to include the attribute `insertLink=""` and insert your video source link you uploaded to the cloud.
```
<web3-video insertLink="https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.mp4">
</web3-video>
```
